# BRAIN PBM - a device for photo bio modulation therapy.
This project aims at making an affordable yet powerful **Photobiomodulation Therapy Device** to **repair and heal** the damaged cells. This device is a prototype to be used for healing psychiatric disorders like depresssion and anxity. The device would be primarily used for teaching and animal study at NIT Rourkela, Odisha India.
